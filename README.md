# MinHeapvsBST | Created: April 2020
This program compares how quickly these two structures, min heap and binary search tree, find the minimum value from different sets of test data.

The following screen is an example of the application running:

I created this application for my Data Structures course to determine the speed of both the Min Heap and Binary Search Tree structure and prove which of the structures was faster at finding the minimum value in a varying range of data.
